# Developer-Profile-Generator

For the Developer-Profile Generator. The purpose if the project was to create a profile that generated for any username that is typed in the username in your node.js. And that profiel will be genrated as a pdf in your directory. The modules that are used in this homework assignment is https://www.npmjs.com/package/pdf-puppeteer. Npm install, and axios to reteive the data from the git hub api https://developer.github.com/v3/. The files that are stored in this directory is an index.html, index.json.package., index.js, and a css framework that uses bootstrap. The project is not complete. The problems that came across this assignemt was the use of the pdf-puppetter.I feel that I was reading the documentation wrong when trying to convert it into a pdf. At first at the end of the creadt.PDF fucntion I used an async function to call the the document resposnes that were being created. But to my suprise it still didn't work. Overall the project still needs some work to be done on it. But I would love to hear our guys feedback about my work.
